    <h1>Tech Talent South Sample Portfolio</h1>

    <p>My name is Ahmad Hasan. This website is part of a project to showcase my knowledge in web development skills,
      and provide information about myself and what I hope to obtain. After studying HTML and CSS in college and bootcamp, I've realized
      I am more interested in front-end development more than back-end, mostly because it's more visual based and it can be more
    interactive with the end-user. Although, I don't mind web development to be my long-term career path, I prefer it to be a tool
    to advance in my career or open doors for new opportunities. The reason for that is because web development and software engineering
    are generally considered "introvert jobs", and I am more used dealing with people whether it's customer based or other co-workers.
  </p>

    </a>


    <p2> The languages I've chosen in the bootcamp to focus on are: </p2>
    <ul>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p2> If I obtain a job as a software developer, this website will be my portfolio which
      will eventually include a GitHub account to show any projects I've worked on.
